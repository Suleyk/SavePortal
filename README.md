   version 11 or later installed on your system. You can download it
   from [Oracle Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
   or [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

## Getting started

### Adding a game

1. Click "Add game."
2. Choose the folder where your game saves are stored.
3. Enter a name for the new game.
4. Click "OK" to confirm.

### Managing profiles

- **Add profile:** Create custom profiles for different playthroughs or characters.
- **Duplicate profile:** Quickly create a copy of a profile, including all its backups.
- **Rename profile:** Personalize your profiles with meaningful names.
- **Delete profile:** Remove unwanted profiles easily.

### Backing up saves

1. When adding a game, the chosen folder will be the target for backups.
2. Click "Import active save" to create a backup of your current game savestate.

### Restoring saves

1. Select from the list the backup you want to restore.
2. Click "Export backup save" to replace the active save with the selected backup.

**_Keep in mind:_** _exporting the backup save will restore the entire folder structure, removing any new subfolders or
files the game created. Make sure you know what each folder contains and how each game manages the savedata._

### **_How importing a save works:_**

When you click **Import**, SavePortal duplicates the entire folder you chose earlier when adding a game. This
duplication includes every file and subfolder inside the selected folder, maintaining the exact structure.

For example:

If the game has this structure:

```
Game Folder
â”œâ”€â”€ GameData1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Textures
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Binaries
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ GameData2
â””â”€â”€ SaveFolder <--------
    â”œâ”€â”€ Slot1
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DataFile1.sav
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DataFile2.sav
    â””â”€â”€ Slot2
        â”œâ”€â”€ DataFile1.sav
        â””â”€â”€ DataFile2.sav
```

By choosing **SaveFolder**, when clicking **Import**, it would create an identical copy:

```
SavePortal
â””â”€â”€ Backups
  â””â”€â”€ AddedGame
    â””â”€â”€ Profile1
        â””â”€â”€ ImportedSave00 <--------
            â”œâ”€â”€ Slot1
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DataFile1.sav
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DataFile2.sav
            â””â”€â”€ Slot2
                â”œâ”€â”€ DataFile1.sav
                â””â”€â”€ DataFile2.sav
```
